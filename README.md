# Server Player List

## See who’s online and how far they are from you!

Ever wondered how many players are currently online on your server, or how far your friends are from you?  
With **Server Player List**, you get a small, unobtrusive panel showing the total number of online players — and, if they’re sharing their location, their names and distances too.

### 🧭 Features

- Displays **number of online players** in a small HUD panel.  
- Shows **player names and distances** (only for players who share their location).  
- Toggle between compact and expanded view using **Right Control + O**.  
  - Compact view: only shows the online player count.  
  - Expanded view: shows names and distances.  
- The panel is **draggable** — click and drag to reposition it (easiest with the mouse cursor visible, e.g. in the ESC menu).  
- Fully **client-side** — doesn’t require server installation.
